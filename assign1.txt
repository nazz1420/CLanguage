1. A computer's main memory consists of transistors that switch between high and low voltage levels — sometimes 5V, sometimes 0.
That reading is done by the computer’s processor which reads the transistor state — high or low — to control the computer’s other 
devices, according to software instructions.

    D. 1.Write down the number.
        2.Divide it by 2 and note the remainder.
        3.Divide the quotient obtained by 2 and note the remainder.
        4.Repeat the same process till we get 0 as the quotient.
        5.Write the values of all the remainders starting from the bottom to the top.
